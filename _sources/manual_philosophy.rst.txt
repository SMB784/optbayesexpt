Philosophy and goals

.. epigraph::

   If it sounds good, it is good.

   -- Duke Ellington

Jazz legend Duke Ellington was talking about music, where it’s all about
the sound. For this package, it’s all about being useful, so we have adopted
a "runs good" philosophy:

-  If it’s a struggle to use, it can’t run good.
-  If technical jargon is a barrier, it can’t run good
-  If the user finds it useful, it runs good.
-  If it runs good, it is good.

The goals are
modest: to adapt some of the developments in optimal Bayeseian
experimental design research for practical use in laboratory settings,
giving users tools to make better measurements.
