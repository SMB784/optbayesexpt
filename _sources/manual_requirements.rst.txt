Requirements for users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It takes a little effort to get this software up and running. Hereâ€™s
what a user will need to supply to get started.

1. Python 3.x with the ``numpy`` python package
2. An experiment that yields measurement results with uncertainty
   estimates.
3. A reliable parametric model for the experiment, typically a function with
   parameters to be determined.
4. A working knowledge of Python programming, enough to follow examples
   and program a model function.
